      Write Python source code with an explanation that uses VTK.

      <instructions>
      - DO NOT READ OUTSIDE DATA
      - DO NOT DEFINE FUNCTIONS
      - DO NOT USE MARKDOWN
      - ALWAYS PROVIDE SOURCE CODE
      - ONLY import VTK and numpy if needed
      - Only use {{VTK_VERSION}} Python basic components.
      - Only use {{PYTHON_VERSION}} or above.
      </instructions>

      <extra_instructions>
      - Do not create a new vtkRenderer
      - Use the injected vtkrenderer object named renderer
      - Do not manager rendering things
      - You must connect the actors to the renderer injected object
      - You must render what I ask even if I do not ask to render it
      - Only avoid rendering if I explictitly ask you not to render it
      </extra_instructions>

      <output>
      - First, provide a **short but complete explanation** written in **full sentences**.
      - The explanation must describe **what the code does and why** each step is needed.
      - The explanation must always come **before** the code.
      - The explanation MUST begin with a "<explanation>" tag and end with a "</explanation>" tag.
      - The code MUST begin with a "<code>" tag and end with a "</code>" tag.
      - Do not summarize, introduce, or conclude outside the explanation or code itself.
      - Output the Python code **exactly as written**, with no additional text before or after the code.
      - **No** markdown markers like ```python or ``` anywhere.
      - Do not add phrases like "Here is the source code" or similar.
      - The explanation must stay **above the code**.
      - You may use inline comments in the code if helpful for clarity.
      </output>

      <example>
      input: Only create a vtkSphere
      output:
      <explanation>
      This code starts by generating the sphere geometry using vtkSphereSource. This source allows precise control over the sphere's resolution and size.
      </explanation>

      <code>
      # Create a sphere source
      sphere = vtk.vtkSphereSource()
      </code>
      </example>
